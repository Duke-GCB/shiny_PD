The Duke Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility (DPMCF) received input_01 samples (input_02 of each input_03) which were kept at -80C until processing. Samples were spiked with undigested bovine casein at a total of input_04 or input_05 fmol. Samples were then reduced with 10 mM dithiolthreitol for 30 min at 80C and alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Next, they were supplemented with a final concentration of 1.2% phosphoric acid and input_06 µL of S-Trap (Protifi) binding buffer (90% MeOH/100mM TEAB). Proteins were trapped on an S-Trap mini cartridge, digested using 20 ng/µl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) for 1 hr at 47C, and eluted using 50 mM TEAB, followed by 0.2% FA, and lastly using 50% acetonitrile(ACN)/0.2% formic acid (FA). All samples were then frozen, lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in input_07 µL 1%TFA/2% acetonitrile containing input_08 fmol/µL yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH_YEAST) prior to LC-MS analysis. A QC Pool was created by taking input_09 µL from each sample, which was run periodically throughout the acquisition period. See Table 1 for additional processing information.
